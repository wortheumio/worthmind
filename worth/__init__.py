"""Worthmind: microservice powering wortheum.news on the Wortheum blockchain.

Worthmind is a "consensus interpretation" layer for the Wortheum blockchain,
maintaining the state of social features such as post news feeds, follows,
and communities. Written in Python, it synchronizes an SQL database
with chain state, providing developers with a more flexible/extensible
alternative to the raw worths API.
